# A 1+sqrt 3 approximation for the Euclidean k-supplier problem

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm presented by Nagarajan, Schieber and Shachnai for the Euclidean k-supplier problem. 
As with any good code, it comes almost completely without tests, and without any warranty of any kind.
